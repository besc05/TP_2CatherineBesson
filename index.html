              <div class="modal-body">
                <H5>THE WEATHER</H5>
                <P>Because remember if you just walk a block or two, it could be completely different. San Francisco is famous for its micro-climates and the famous fog usually doesn’t linger for long and temperatures seldom rise above a temperate 70 degrees.</P>
              
                <H5>THESE HILLS WERE MADE FOR WALKING</H5>
                <P>San Francisco is one of the most walkable cities in the U.S. Within a few blocks you can go from Union Square to Chinatown to and within a few minutes find yourself in North Beach.</P>
              
                <H5>CABLE CARS THAT CLIMB HALFWAY TO TE STARS</H5>
                <P>No exaggeration. Don’t leave San Francisco without taking a ride. Every ride offers spectacular views of the city’s celebrated hills.</P>
              
                <H5>FOOD</H5>
                <P>San Francisco has more restaurants per capita than any other major city in the U.S. Local chefs excel at combining the best of local ingredients with authentic international flavors.</P>
              
                <H5>CLASSIC AND QUIRKY</H5>
                <P>The famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright once quipped, “What I like best about San Francisco is San Francisco.” That seems to say it all. A combination of classic and quirky, icons and the iconoclastic.  And somehow it all works together. Just like peanut butter and jelly.</P>

 		New York – often called New York City or the City of New York to distinguish it from the State of New York, of which it is a part – is the most populous city in the United States and the center of the New York metropolitan area, the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States and one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.<br>

              </div>
              <div class="modal-body">
                <H5>SEE A BROADWAY SHOW</H5>
                <P>Times Square is home (or very close) to many of New York City's Broadway theaters, so if you want to see a real Broadway production, this is your chance. You can purchase tickets in advance or at the individual box offices, but for budget-minded folks, Time Square is also where the original TKTS Booth is located. At the TKTS booth you can buy same day tickets to see a variety of musicals and plays (as well as some dance performances and off-Broadway shows) at a substantial discount (sometimes as much as half price!)</P>
              
                <H5>VISIT LIFE-LIKE CELEBRITIES AND HISTORICAL FIGURES</H5>
                <P>No, I'm not talking about the various folks dressed up as Dora and Elmo milling around Times Square for a photo op -- I'm talking about visiting Madame Tussaud's New York. Madame Tussaud's has been impressing audiences for over 200 years with its life-like wax figures, and the New York City location in Times Square has been entertaining visitors since 2000. If you and your traveling companions are bored of typical museums, Madame Tussaud's might surprise you -- there are lots of interactive exhibits and they are always introducing new celebrity figures to their lineup. It's also open until 10 p.m. nightly, so if you're looking for a family-friendly activity to do after dinner, this is a great choice.</P>
              
                <H5>PEOPLE WATCH</H5>
                <P>Although the energy of this area can be frenetic, visitors should definitely take some time to soak in the vibe and bask in the lights of the glowing billboards and Broadway marquees. There are lots of pedestrian plazas, many with (free) seating and the TKTS booth was designed with a huge cascade of steps that are the perfect place to take a load off and watch the world whiz by.</P>
              
                <H5>RIDE A FERRIS WHEEL</H5>
                <P>Ok, you have to be a little bit crazy to bring your kids into a toy store, especially one like the flagship Toys 'R Us in Times Square, but where else can ride a ferris wheel in Manhattan? The store itself is destination-worthy, with lots of salespeople demonstrating new, exciting toys, and plenty of photo ops. If you know you won't escape without making a purchase, there are plenty of NYC-themed items that make perfect souvenirs.</P>
              
                <H5>RING IN THE NEW YEAR</H5>
                <P>If you're tired of watching the countdown on TV, maybe it's time you watch the New Year's Eve ball drop live in Times Square! The first New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square was held in 1904 and three years later they began the tradition of the NYE ball drop, which has continued annually (except in 1942-43 due to wartime restrictions.) More than one million people each year attend the live event in Times Square -- maybe you should too!</P>

		<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4"><h3>Las Vegas</h3>
		Las Vegas, officially the City of Las Vegas and often known as simply Vegas, is a city in the United States, the most populous city in the state of Nevada, the county seat of Clark County, and the city proper of the Las Vegas Valley. Las Vegas is an internationally renowned major resort city known primarily for gambling, shopping, fine dining and nightlife and is the leading financial and cultural center for Southern Nevada.</br>

                <H5>BELLAGIO FOUNTAINS</H5>
                <P>People stare at lots of free shows outside the hotels, but there's only one worth going to: the Bellagio fountains. Every half-hour between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m., and every 15 minutes from then 'til midnight, an 8.5-acre lake in the middle of the desert explodes with 1,214 spritzers shooting water up to 460 feet in the air — the water rockets and dances, perfectly choreographed to Frank Sinatra or Gene Kelly or "One Singular Sensation" from A Chorus Line. And yet, for some reason, it doesn't feel all that gay, which is quite a feat.</P>
              
                <H5>CIRQUE DU SOLEIL</H5>
                <P>ven though it's expensive, cuts three hours out of your evening and sounds really boring, it's actually really cool and totally Vegas, despite its French Canadian origins — you can see Elton John anywhere, after all. The Cirque hires former Olympic gymnasts to catapult themselves all over the stage, risking their lives in outlandish costumes just for your amusement. I was in the Cirque offices once, and saw several people enter on crutches or in casts to collect their checks. If Wayne Newton ever ends up on crutches, I'll go see him.</P>
              
                <H5>BREAKFAST BUFFET AT THE WYNN</H5>
                <P>John Cusack once told me, at a post-fight party at the House of Blues, that you never want to wake up in Vegas. Cusack has apparently never been to the right breakfast buffet. Sure, the intimate, beautiful Payard at Caesars serves one of the best French breakfasts outside of Paris (get a quiche and an almond croissant), but you can't do Vegas without doing a buffet, and the buffet at the Wynn is one of the few with really good food. The buffet at T.I., which changed its named from Treasure Island, KFC-style, is also pretty good and has a room designed by Adam Tihany. But the Wynn is a little better — plus, it's not at Treasure Island.</P>
              
                <H5>SHARK REEF AQUARIUM</H5>
                <P>I get dragged by my wife to a lot of aquariums, so I know that the Shark Reef at the Mandalay Bay is, even at $16, a good one: half-outdoors, half-indoors, with rays, sea turtles, crocodiles, lots of sharks and, as of recently, a komodo dragon. If you're staying at the Mandalay Bay, you can turn to the Shark Reef channel and watch sharks live 24 hours a day on TV, which is pretty awesome at 4 a.m. when you're totally wasted.</P>
              
                <H5>DOWNTOWN</H5>
                <P>Maybe you're Nicolas Cage in Leaving Las Vegas and the happy-roller-coaster-fake-New-York-acrobat-show Vegas isn't quite right for your alcoholic suicidal mood. Or maybe you lack the depth, but want to write moody punk songs anyway. That's when you go downtown to the tiny, old part of Las Vegas that is technically the only part of the city where Mayor Oscar Goodman has jurisdiction. It's seedy and ugly and makes you feel like an outlaw. I've played poker at Binions — home of the World Series of Poker — at a table where everyone but me looked like one of those old men under the ghost masks on Scooby Doo. The city's first step in sprucing up downtown is the the sort-of-cool, sort-of-depressing Fremont Street Experience, where parents bring their kids to watch the outdoor mall's ceiling tell little vignettes in laser lights, like a Western Stone Mountain. Then they give blood for slot machine money.</P>
